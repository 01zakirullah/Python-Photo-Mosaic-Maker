# Python-Photo-Mosaic-Maker
A Python language script that would take a collection of pictures and a target picture to create a photo mosaic of the target picture using the collection.

This project was done back in 2015 to learn python programming and image processing.

There are two files, one is intended for grayscale images mosaic and other for colored mosaic.
Each uses a different method to calculate the type of image to be selected from collection images for the target picture.
Input:  Collection Folder. (100 images)
        Target Image.
Output: PhotoMosaic of the Target Image Using Images from Collection.
